##Introduction

YoutubeBG is an application for Android devices, that let's you browse through Youtube videos, create a playlist out of them and play them either in the Youtube player or in the background/locked screen. It is a fun non-profit project I made to utilize everything I've learned so far and to challenge myself in learning industry standard libraries (Retrofit for REST API and RxJava 2 for Reactive programming).
