# YoutubeBackground
## Introduction

YoutubeBG is an application for Android devices, that let's you browse through Youtube videos, create a playlist out of them and play them either in the Youtube player or in the background/locked screen. It is a fun non-profit project I made to utilize everything I've learned so far and to challenge myself in learning industry standard libraries (Retrofit for REST API and RxJava 2 for Reactive programming).

## Technologies

- RxJava 2
- Retrofit
- Room Database
- LiveData
- Design pattern - MVVM

## Dependencies

This project makes use of:
- Youtube Data API
- Youtube Player API
- [PierfrancescoSoffritti's android-youtube-player](https://github.com/PierfrancescoSoffritti/android-youtube-player)

## Features

- Browse and play Youtube videos
- Create a playlist of videos, shuffle and play them
- Turn on the background option and listen to the videos in the background or with the locked screen
